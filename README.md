Dumpy Narcowich is quite a sight,
With curves that make the fellas light,

He waddles when he walks,
And when he sits, his booty talks.

His hips are wide, his thighs are thick,
A sight that makes your heart skip,

He's got the kind of dumpy grace,
That puts a smile on every face.

When he's walking down the street,
People stop and stare at his meat,

And when he shakes that dumpy thang,
The ground beneath him seems to hang.

So if you're feeling kinda down,
Just think of Narcowich and his crown,

Of dumpy curves and ample size,
And let your worries vaporize.
