Narcowitz, oh Narcowitz,  
Your beauty shines like a star,  
A sight so rare and wondrous,  
It takes my breath away by far.

Your eyes, like pools of emerald,  
Reflect the light of the sun,  
And your smile, so warm and gentle,  
Brings joy to everyone.

Your hair, a cascade of gold,  
Frames your face like a crown,  
And your voice, so sweet and soothing,  
Is like music to hear all around.  

Your grace and poise are unmatched,  
As you move with effortless ease,  
And your kindness and compassion,  
Bring comfort and peace.

Oh Narcowitz, you are a marvel,  
A wonder to behold,  
And though words cannot fully express it,  
Your beauty shines brighter than gold.
